### Set up

1. IDE Set up - add support for [no sound null safety](
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64917744/cannot-run-with-sound-null-safety-because-dependencies-dont-support-null-safety).
2. set up [amplify CLI](https://docs.amplify.aws/start/getting-started/installation/q/integration/flutter/#option-2-follow-the-instructions). When setting amplify, you will be asked to specify aws region, choose the following option: `us-west-2` or your desired AWS region.
3. init amplify by `amplify pull --appId YOUR_AWS_AMPLIFY_APP_ID --envName staging`


### Env
1. feature branch -> amplify feature env
   - Any new code branch named as feature/** will be connected with an automatically created amplify env.
   - Please use this combination for any local feature testing.
   - Please remove the unused automatically created env whenever the feature branch is merged into master branch..
2. master branch -> amplify staging env
   - Please use this combination for any pre-prod testing. Any production release should be verified through this stage first. 
   - This is the default env connected to the frontend.
3. release branch -> amplify prod env
   - Please use this combination for any production release.
   - Any change must be verified in #2 env first, then merged/promoted into this env.
   - To each release, please create a tag to the commit for tracking the release version.
4. dev branch -> amplify dev env
   - Please use this combination for any local change testing, if you have to deploy it to server side to verify.
   - This is a shared env, so that your local change may be overridden by others. Please use #1 if you have any concern with this.
